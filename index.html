            <h3>Associate Degree</h3>
            <p>Save
                What is an Associate’s Degree?
                If you’re from outside the US or Canada, you’ve probably heard of bachelor’s degrees, master’s degrees and PhDs, but perhaps not an associate’s degree.
                So, what is an associate’s degree, where is it offered, and how can you decide if it’s the right choice for you? Here’s a quick guide…
                What is an associate’s degree?
                An associate’s degree is an academic program taken at the undergraduate level (the first stage after secondary school). It aims to give students the basic technical and academic knowledge and transferable skills they need to go on to employment or further study in their chosen field.</p>

        <h3>Bachelors</h3>
        <p>A bachelor's degree (from Middle Latin baccalaureus) or baccalaureate (from Modern Latin baccalaureatus) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to six years (depending on institution and academic discipline). The two most common bachelor's degrees are the Bachelor of Arts (BA) and the Bachelor of Science (BS or BSc). In some institutions and educational systems, certain bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate educations after a first degree has been completed, although more commonly the successful completion of a bachelor's degree is a prerequisite for further courses such as a master's or a doctorate.</p>

        <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Masters</h3>
        <p>A master's degree[note 1] (from Latin magister) is an academic degree awarded by universities or colleges upon completion of a course of study demonstrating mastery or a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice.[1] A master's degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor's level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied, master's graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently.</p>
