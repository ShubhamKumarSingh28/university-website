    </h2>
    <h3><center>Vision</center></h3>
    <p>To bring forth professionally competent and socially sensible engineers, capable of working across cultures
        meeting the global standards ethically.</p>
    <h3><center>Mission</center></h3>
    <p>To provide students with an extensive and exceptional education that prepares them to excel in their profession,
        guided by dynamic intellectual community and be able to face the technically complex world with creative
        leadership qualities.</p>
    <p>Further, be instrumental in emanating new knowledge through innovative research that emboldens entrepreneurship
        and economic development for the benefit of wide spread community.</p>
    <h3><center>Quality Policy</center></h3>
    <p>Our policy is to nurture and build diligent and dedicated community of engineers providing a professional and
        unprejudiced environment, thus justifying the purpose of teaching and satisfying the stake holders.</p>
    <p>A team of well qualified and experienced professionals ensure quality education with its practical application in
        all areas of the Institute.</p>
    <h3><center>Philosophy</center></h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The essence of learning lies in pursuing the truth that liberates one from the darkness of ignorance and
            Institute of Aeronautical Engineering firmly believes that education is for liberation.</p>
        <p>Contained therein is the notion that engineering education includes all fields of science that plays a
            pivotal role in the development of world-wide community contributing to the progress of civilization. This
            institute, adhering to the above understanding, is committed to the development of science and technology in
            congruence with the natural environs. It lays great emphasis on intensive research and education that blends
            professional skills and high moral standards with a sense of individuality and humanity. We thus promote
            ties with local communities and encourage transnational interactions in order to be socially accountable.
            This accelerates the process of transfiguring the students into complete human beings making the learning
            process relevant to life, instilling in them a sense of courtesy and responsibility.</p>
